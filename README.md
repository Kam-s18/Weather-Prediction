# Weather-Prediction
Farmers face a lot of problems with production of their crops because of uncertainty in weather. 
Prediction tasks may help them in direct or indirect manner like weather forecasting, rain prediction etc. 
We used a multivariable regression to predict the weather forecast of a particular week using a dataset containing around 15000+ instances of weather data during the years 2021-2022 in India.
The model is deployed on streamlit-based web app
